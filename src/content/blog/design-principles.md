The Astro Haze theme is built on several core design principles that create a cohesive and beautiful user experience. Let's explore these principles and how they shape the theme.

## Glassmorphism at its Core

Glassmorphism is more than just a trend—it's a design language that creates depth and hierarchy through transparency and blur effects.

### Key Elements

1. **Background Blur**: Creates the frosted glass effect
2. **Transparency**: Allows content layering
3. **Subtle Borders**: Defines edges with light strokes
4. **Vivid Colors**: Enhanced through the glass effect

## Visual Hierarchy

We use several techniques to establish clear visual hierarchy:

- **Contrast**: Between glass panels and content
- **Size**: Larger elements draw attention first
- **Color**: Accent colors guide the eye
- **Space**: Generous spacing improves readability

## Performance Considerations

While glassmorphism can be resource-intensive, we've optimized for performance:

```css
/* Optimized glass effect */
.glass {
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  will-change: transform;
}
```

### Performance Tips

- Limit the number of blurred elements
- Use `will-change` sparingly
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- Optimize images with modern formats

## Accessibility First

Beautiful design should be accessible to everyone:

- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences

## Responsive Design

The theme adapts seamlessly across devices:

| Breakpoint | Description    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Mobile     | < 768px        |
| Tablet     | 768px - 1024px |
| Desktop    | > 1024px       |

## Color Philosophy

Our color system is designed for flexibility:

- **Primary**: Brand identity
- **Accent**: Interactive elements
- **Neutral**: Content and backgrounds
- **Semantic**: Success, warning, error states

## Conclusion

Astro Haze demonstrates that modern web design can be both beautiful and functional. By adhering to these principles, we've created a theme that's not just visually striking, but also performant, accessible, and user-friendly.
